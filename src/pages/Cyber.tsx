            <div className="text-sm mr-28 pt-12 sm: pt-12">
              Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers,
              mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from
              malicious attacks. Itâ€™s also known as information technology
              security or electronic information security. This is used by
              individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access
              to data centers and other computerized systems.
              <br></br>
              <br />
              Cybersecurity is a continuously changing field, with the
              development of technologies that open up new avenues for
              cyber-attacks. To protect organizations, employees and
              individuals, organizations and services should implement
              cybersecurity tools, training, risk management approaches and
              continually update systems as technologies change and evolve.

              <br />
              Benefits of utilizing cybersecurity includes:
              <br />
              <br />
              <li>
                Business protection against malware, ransomware, phishing and
                social engineering. Protection for data and networks.

            <div className="text-sm mr-28 pt-12 sm:pt-12">
              Cybersecurity is continually challenged by hackers, data loss,
              privacy, risk management, and changing cybersecurity strategies.
              Nothing currently indicates that cyber-attacks will decrease.
              Moreover, with the more entry points, there are for attacks, the
              more cybersecurity is needed to secure networks and devices.
              <br></br>
              <br />
              One of the most problematic elements of cybersecurity is the
              continually evolving nature of security risks. As new technologies
              emerge, and technology is used in new or different ways, new
              avenues of attack are developed as well.
